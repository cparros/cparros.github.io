This is my personal website. It was started in the UNC Coding Bootcamp as a way to work on Bootstrap and semantic HTML. I am continually working on upgrading and experimenting with features. 

Currenty I am fixinf margin and padding issues and cleaning up the code.
I was given Screenshots to "mimic" although the site didnt need to look exactly like the Screenshots. This was an excellent exercise and I am excited to continue working on it!
