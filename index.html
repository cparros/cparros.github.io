            <p class="bio">
              My journey as a developer was not a typical journey. I grew up in a VERY creative home and fell in love with cbuilding, drawing, and any form of creativity I could be a part of. I was encouraged to be active, and creative, and became involved in sports. Sports taught me to always give my best regardless of circumstances. It was with that mindset that able to earn a scholarship to run at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I ran there for 4 years. While there I was a team captain, all American, and graduate of the Carolina Leadership Academy as a Leader of Distinction. After receiving my degree I was presented with a once in a lifetime opportunity, to continue to run professionally. I ran for 3 years, during which I was able to travel, became an IAAF World Champion for team USA, run for Nike and Adidas, and even participated in the US Olympic trials in 2016, after which, I retired.

            <p class="bio">
              When I retired began a career in coaching. It was fun, but it wasn't as fulfilling as I thought it would be. I enjoyed my athletes, leading, teaching, helping people achieve their goals, and passing along my knowledge, but I wasn't scratching the creative itch I had. One day saw a friend of mine coding. I asked him how he liked it. I knew he did not graduate with a Computer Science degree and intrigued, I got 3 books, an online course, and decided to test the waters. When I started my first book, an HTML and CSS book by Jon Duckett, and read through half of it in one day, I was hooked, and I have been ever since. I have worked freelance on a few projects and am currently working towards a Full-Stack Developer Certification from The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and on a few personal projects attempting to learn more concepts/ languages like Python, AWS and Machine learning. I am currently looking for a way to get myself into a more professional setting and associate myself with hard working passionate people.

            <p class="bio">
              Having been an athlete in the past I believe I bring a bit of my competitive side with me. I definitely want to be seen as one of the best at anything I do. Not in a cutthroat way, but as a hard working and thoughtful person. I will put in the time, read the documentation, ask questions, and attempt to understand what I'm doing and who I'm working with and the client I am working for. having been a coach I am not one to just complete a task so that it is done, I want to do it right. Having found out what is possible, and where being a developer could take me, as well as, the unique perspective I could bring as a former athlete and champion I believe there are no limits to what I or any company could do together.
