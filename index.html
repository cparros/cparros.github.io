            <h4>My search for creativity and purpose has brought me through a door to
            the future. 
            <br>This is my journey.</h4>

          <div>

            <p>
              
              I grew up in a VERY creative home and fell in love with
              construction, drawing, and any form of creativity I could be
              involved in. I was encouraged to be active, as well as creative,
              and became involved in a few sports. Ice hockey, basketball and
              track were my main passions, but eventually one became my love,
              and that was track and field. Sports taught me to always put my
              best efforts in everything I do and it was with that mindset I was
              able to earn a scholarship to run at The University of North
              Carolina at Chapel Hill where I ran for 4 years. While there I was
              also a team captain, all American, and graduate of the Carolina
              Leadership Academy as a Leader of Distinction. After receiving my
              degree I was presented with a once in a lifetime opportunity, to
              continue to run professionally. I ran for 3 years, during which I
              was able to travel, became a world champion for team USA, run for
              nike and Adidas, and even participated in the US Olympic trials in
              2016, after which, I retired.
            </p>
            <p>I then began a career in coaching. It was fun, but it wasn't
              as fulfilling as I thought it would be. I enjoyed my athletes,
              leading, teaching, helping people achieve their goals, and passing
              along my knowledge, but I wasn't scratching the creative itch I
              was getting. I began looking for ways I could reignite that
              creative fire within myself and one day saw a friend of mine
              coding. I asked him how he liked it, and I knew he did not
              graduate with a Computer Science degree. Intrigued, I got 3 books
              and looked at an online course and decided to test the waters.
              Once I started my first book, an HTML and CSS book by Jon Duckett,
              and read through half of it in one day, I was hooked, and I have
              been ever since that day. I have got through some javascript and
              am currently working on a few personal projects attempting to
              learn more concepts and to continue to practice, but am looking
              for a way to get myself into a more professional setting and
              associate myself with hard working passionate people.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having been an athlete in the past I bring a bit of my competitive side
              with me. I definitely want to be seen as one of the best at
              anything I do. Not in a cutthroat way, but as a hard working
              thoughtful person. I will put in the time, read the documentation,
              ask questions, and attempt to understand what I'm doing and who
              I'm working with and the client I am working for. As a coach I am
              not one to just complete a task so that it is done, I want to do
              it right. Having found out what is possible, and where being a
              developer could take me, as well as, the unique perspective I
              could bring as a former athlete and champion
