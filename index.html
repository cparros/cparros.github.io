        I grew up in a VERY creative home and fell in love with construction, drawing, and any form of creativity I could be involved in. I was encouraged to be active, as well as creative, and became involved in a few sports. Ice hockey, basketball and track were my main passions, but eventually one became my love, and that was track and field.  Sports taught me to always put my best efforts in everything I do and it was with that mindset I was able to earn a scholarship to run at The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill where I ran for 4 years. While there I was also a team captain, all American, and graduate of the Carolina Leadership Academy as a Leader of Distinction. After receiving my degree I was presented with a once in a lifetime opportunity, to continue to run professionally. I ran for 3 years, during which I was able to travel, became a world champion for team USA, run for nike and Adidas, and even participated in the US Olympic trials in 2016, after which, I retired.

        I retired I began a career in coaching. It was fun, but it wasn't as fulfilling as I thought it would be. I enjoyed my athletes, leading, teaching, helping people achieve their goals, and passing along my knowledge, but I wasn't scratching the creative itch I was getting. I began looking for ways I could reignite that creative fire within myself and one day saw a friend of mine coding. I asked him how he liked it, and I knew he did not graduate with a Computer Science degree. Intrigued, I got 3 books and looked at an online course and decided to test the waters. Once I started my first book, an HTML and CSS book by Jon Duckett, and read through half of it in one day, I  was hooked, and I have been ever since that day. I have got through some javascript and am currently working on a few personal projects attempting to learn more concepts and to continue to practice, but am looking for a way to get myself into a more professional setting and associate myself with hard working passionate people.

         been an athlete in the past I bring a bit of my competitive side with me. I definitely want to be seen as one of the best at anything I do. Not in a cutthroat way, but as a hard working thoughtful person. I will put in the time, read the documentation, ask questions, and attempt to understand what I'm doing and who I'm working with and the client I am working for. As a coach I am not one to just complete a task so that it is done, I want to do it right. Having found out what is possible, and where being a developer could take me, as well as, the unique perspective I could bring as a former athlete and champion
